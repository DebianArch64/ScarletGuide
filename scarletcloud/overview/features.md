# Features

## Multi-Device support

ScarletCloud supports multiple devices for one apple account and can be used simultaneously.

## No 10 App Id limit

There is no 10 App Id limit with ScarletCloud. You can install as many apps as you want a week as long as you have only three active at a time.

## Functionality

ScarletCloud uses many techniques that have **never** been used before. This implementation doesn't use corecrypto or any other apple frameworks and logic for _when and how_ to generate anisette are handled in a way that improves performance.&#x20;



Nothing is [revoked ](../../scarlet/scarlet-direct/revokes.md)with ScarletCloud unless absolutely necessary and the device will generate its own certificate if it can't fetch one from ScarletCloud or if both use different apple accounts.
